Command injection:

The upgrade_filter_asp function has command injection；
The received request is sent to parm; And parm doesn't do any filtering;
parm data is sent to v17 through strcpy, and then only "http://" is matched without any filtering；
Splice to v16 through sprintf, and finally system(v16); Cause command injection;

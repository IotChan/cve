Affected Versions:

GIGA WIFI Wave 2 - KM08-708H

Vulnerability Description:

There is a buffer overflow vulnerability in the `sub_445BDC()` function within the `/usr/sbin/goahead` program. After being filtered, the parameter `a1` is assigned to `v27` and subsequently passed to `v72` through a `sprintf` concatenation. Since both `a1` and `v27` are controllable, and `v72` has a length of 9464, the concatenation with the `sprintf` function can cause a buffer overflow. This eventually leads to a segmentation fault, rendering the service inaccessible.
